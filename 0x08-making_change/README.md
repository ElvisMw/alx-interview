# 0x08. Making Change

## Description

This project involves solving the classic coin change problem using dynamic programming. The goal is to determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total from a pile of coins of different values.

## Concepts Covered

- **Greedy Algorithms**
  - Understanding the basics of greedy algorithms and their limitations.
  
- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Learning the principles of dynamic programming.
  - Understanding overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
  
- **Algorithmic Complexity**
  - Analyzing time and space complexity.
  
- **Problem-Solving Strategies**
  - Breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.
  - Using iterative approaches in dynamic programming.

## Requirements

- The code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x).
- All your files must be executable.

## Files

- `0-making_change.py`: Contains the implementation of the coin change algorithm.
- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing the implementation.

## Prototype

```python
def makeChange(coins, total):
